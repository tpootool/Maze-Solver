To show the tests I have done, I have listed my tests in a table format.
The table consists of what I have done, what I expect and what actually happened.


Input             | Expected Output  | Actual Output
----------------------------------------------------------
-No path entered  | -Error message   | -Does as expected 
 on command line  |  displays and    |
